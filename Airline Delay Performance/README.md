# Airline Delay Performance
A study that would benefit airlines by comparing airline performances and predicting possibilities of delay based on aircraft/origin/destination and applying corrective measures
to reduce cancellations and delays and to improve on-time performance.

### Description
Airline cancellations or delays are one of the major causes of passenger inconvenience. This project aims to gain meaningful insights into the best-performing airlines 
and understanding the causes of delays and cancellations across different airline carriers. As a performance measure, we would be exploring on-time arrivals, 
the number of cancellations by carrier, and also explore different reasons for a carrier delay.  

### Data Source 
[Department of Transportation(DOT)] (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/airline-on-time-performance-and-causes-of-flight-delays/)
Data was collected by DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics for the year 2022. The purpose of this data is to analyze airline on-time performance reported by carriers. 
The datasets has around 40 fields in total of which I will be considering between 15 to 25 columns for analysis.
