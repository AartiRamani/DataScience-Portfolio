## Airline Delay Prediction 
A project that uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict flight delays. 
 

### Description
Airline cancellations or delays are one of the major causes of passenger inconvenience. This project aims to gain meaningful insights into the best-performing airlines and understanding the causes of delays and cancellations across different airline carriers. As a performance measure, we would be exploring on-time arrivals, the number of cancellations by carrier, and also explore different reasons for a carrier delay.  

### Data Source 

Data was collected by DOT's Bureau of Transportation. The Excel data has airline performance factors such as canceled, diverted, delayed, and on-time data. The downloaded raw data has up to 34 columns. 
Download Raw Data link for data - (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E).
Due to the execution size limitation, this study is restricted to one month of airline data, Mayâ€™2022.
