## Breast Cancer Prediction 
A study to analyze breast cancer data and apply machine learning techniques to enable early detection of breast cancer.

### Description
Breast cancer, a complex and formidable adversary, demands meticulous scrutiny and proactive interventions to minimize its impact. 
This project embarks on a journey to leverage the power of predictive modeling to enhance the early detection of breast cancer, a pressing concern that deeply impacts the lives of countless individuals.

### Data Source 
The breast cancer dataset is sourced from Kaggle - ( https://www.kaggle.com/code/pmotta/breast-cancer-prediction/input) and it contains essential features that capture the fundamental health factors of breast cancer patients. These features have been determined to be sufficient for the purpose of prediction. The selected dataset is relatively small and only a modest amount of cleaning and preparation steps was required.
