## Heart Attack Prediction 
A project focused on analyzing heart attack prediction data using machine learning techniques to advance healthcare and save lives.  

### Description
In the realm of healthcare, the ability to predict and prevent heart attacks holds immense significance. Leveraging the power of machine learning, we delve into the world of heart attack predictionâ€”a pivotal endeavor aimed at saving lives.  

### Data Source 
The heart attack dataset is sourced from Kaggle - ( https://www.kaggle.com/code/fahadmehfoooz/heartattack-prediction-with-91-8-accuracy/input?select=heart.csv).
This dataset has around 12 features with around 900 rows.
