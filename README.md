## 1. Airline Performance  
  ###### Description: 
    Airline cancellations or delays are one of the major causes of passenger inconvenience. This project aims to gain meaningful insights into the best-performing airlines
    and understanding the causes of delays and cancellations across different airline carriers.
    As a performance measure, we would be exploring on-time arrivals, the number of cancellations by carrier, and also explore different reasons for a carrier delay.  
  
## 2. Airline Delay Prediction 
   ###### Description:
    Passenger inconvenience is often caused by airline cancellations and delays, making it an important issue to address in the airline industry. 
    As someone who works in this field, I have always been fascinated by market prediction and flight performance measures.  
    Using different models, this project aims to determine the best approach to predict the likelihood of a flight being either on time or delayed.
  
## 3. Breast Cancer Prediction  
  ###### Description:
    Breast cancer, a complex and formidable adversary, demands meticulous scrutiny and proactive interventions to minimize its impact. 
    This project embarks on a journey to leverage the power of predictive modeling to enhance the early detection of breast cancer, a pressing concern that deeply impacts the lives of     
    countless individuals.  
  
## 4. Credit Card Fraud Prediction  
  ###### Description:
    With the growing prevalence of credit card fraud, businesses, and financial institutions face a critical challenge. A problem that needs an effective solution to detect and prevent   
    fraudulent transactions in real time. This project aims to use machine learning to build a robust fraud prediction system that distinguishes legitimate from fraudulent credit card 
    transactions.    
  
## 5. Airline Travel Safety  
  ###### Description:
    In a world inundated with constant news updates, aviation incidents often capture our attention and raise concerns among even the most intrepid travelers. This project embarks on a 
    statistical exploration, spanning the years 1985 to 2014, to shed light on the reality of airline safety. Through insightful visualizations, informative blogs, and engaging 
    infographics, we aim to uncover the truth about flight safety and provide valuable insights to the aviation community and the public.
  
## 6. Movie Recommender System  
  ###### Description:
    In a world overflowing with entertainment options, finding the perfect movie can be a daunting task. This project is designed to simplify the process by leveraging machine learning 
    algorithms to recommend movies tailored to users' tastes and preferences.
  
## 7. Sentiment Analysis  
  ###### Description:
    In today's digital age, opinions and sentiments are expressed abundantly across the web, from social media posts to product reviews. This project harnesses the power of machine 
    learning to analyze and understand these sentiments.
  
## 8. Diabetes Data EDA  
  ###### Description:
  Diabetes is a prevalent health concern worldwide, affecting millions of lives. This project project meticulously examines a vast dataset, unveiling hidden patterns and correlations. By 
  visualizing and summarizing key factors, we helps healthcare professionals and researchers to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies for diabetes management and 
  prevention.

## 9. Heart Attack Prediction  
  ###### Description:
     Heart attacks are a leading cause of sudden and fatal deaths globally, often requiring immediate medical intervention.  It is a significant global health concern due to lifestyle-   
     related risk factors, an aging population, healthcare costs, and treatment gaps. Despite significant advancements in medical science, Heart disease still remains the leading cause of
     death in the United States, with the CDC reporting approximately 659,000 annual fatalities, accounting for one in every four deaths. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this 
     project delves into the world of heart attack prediction.

## 10. Weather Application
  ###### Description:
  A python program that accepts the user input for city name and zip code and provides the weather information for that location.
